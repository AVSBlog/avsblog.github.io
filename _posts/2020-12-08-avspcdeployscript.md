This script will prompt for the inputs, validate your subscription is enabled for deployment and then deploy an Azure VMware Solution Private Cloud.  

After completion there will be a summary of the Private Cloud after deployment (see image below).

Going to work to add some post deployment add-ons soon.  But in the meantime, hope this may provide some value.
