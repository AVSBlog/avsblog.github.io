## Automated Nested ESXi

Wanted to make everyone aware of a great blog post by [William Lam](https://twitter.com/lamw).  The article outlines how to automate a nested vSphere lab inside of Azure VMware Solution.  You can find that blog post [here](https://www.virtuallyghetto.com/2020/10/automated-nested-lab-deployment-on-sddc-part-2-azure-vmware-solution.html).

Also, I wrote a [blog article](https://avs.ms/azure-vmware-solution-nested-esxi/) some time back which may be useful if you are going to build your own vSphere hosts for the nested environment.
